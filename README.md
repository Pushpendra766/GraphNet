## GraphNet 📊

**Graphnet** is a Javascript graph library that is created as a module for the semantic UI framework. Whereas Graphnet dynamically renders all nodes and edges via websocket connections, node and edge positioning algorithms such as force, random, circular, and others are provided within the Graphnet as builtin modules.

> 📝**NOTE** : This library is in early stage of development. Some inaccuracies may occur.

## Algorithms 🧮

### 1. Forced-directed algorithm

[Force-directed graph drawing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way. Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.

### 2. Circular algorithm

A circular node positioning algorithm is a method used to arrange nodes in a network graph (also known as a node-link diagram) in a circular layout. In a circular layout, nodes are positioned along the circumference of a circle, and the edges are drawn as arcs between the nodes. This layout can be particularly useful for visualizing relationships in a cyclic or circular manner, or when there is a natural circular hierarchy present in the data.
